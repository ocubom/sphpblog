BUGS
- align titles appropriately
- plus/minus button on menus not working. are these pointless 
since the next page will just show them again?  should we use session cookies to 
remember it?

- switch capcha to recapcha? we need to figure out the keying
- fix urls in plugins
- move install pages to separate directory
- integrate gallery
- integrate guest book?
- separate color schemes from themes
- create language maintenance tools
